# Elmar Solar Fork

Elmar Solar Forked this project. 

The goals of this fork are:

* Make this hardware more accecible and easier to produce.
* Produce 1 MPPT, for a price lower than the current price offered by Tjitte, and characterize it's efficiency using a WT5000.  
* Make a Value Stream Map so it becomes insightful where value is added and how the project is managed. 
* Add alternative suppliers for parts to it's BOM to get redudundant suppliers for all parts and negotiate better production price.
* Modify the design to improve efficiency  

Right now it's undecided if the efficiency measurements or modifications that lead to efficency improvements get published.

### Verison ###

The output folder contains two verison. the only major diference between the two versions is the CAN-bus connector that is used. V0.2.0 contains easy to source microfit connectors and is the recomended design.
